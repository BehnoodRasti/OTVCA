# OTVCA
Hyperspectral Feature Extraction Using Total Variation Component Analysis (OTVCA)

This code implements a new-version of OTVCA which does not include whitening stage. OTVCA was illustrated in the following Paper. B. Rasti, M. O. Ulfarsson, and J. R. Sveinsson,” Hyperspectral Feature Extraction Using Total Variation Component Analysis”, IEEE Trans. Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 54 (12), 6976-6985.
